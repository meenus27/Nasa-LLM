These results suggest SIRT may be beneficial in maintaining healthy myocytes in microgravity through promoting appropriate mitochondrial energy production required for cellular action .  Rats were elevated at a spinal angle of 40\u00b0 so that hindfeet were approximately 1 cm off the cage floor . At the end of the 10-day hindlimb unloading period, rats from all groups were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) Rats were attached to a crosswire through a swivel that allowed ambulation around the cage ."
