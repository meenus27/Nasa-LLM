Kristina Buss was primarily responsible for the subsequent bioinformatics data collection and analysis . Both authors contributed equally to the analysis and interpretation of results .  The draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas paucimobilis was determined through whole genome sequencing and assembly . Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to strains BAB-7166 (99%) and NBRC 13937 (99%), based on 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods ."
